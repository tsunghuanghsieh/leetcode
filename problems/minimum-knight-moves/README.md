# [1197. Minimum Knight Moves](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/) (**Premium**)

In an **infinite** chess board with coordinates from `-infinity` to `+infinity`, you have a **knight** at square `[0, 0]`.

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

Return _the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square `[x, y]`_. It is guaranteed the answer exists.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 2, y = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 5, y = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]
```

**Constraints:**
* `-300 <= x, y <= 300`
* `0 <= |x| + |y| <= 300`
