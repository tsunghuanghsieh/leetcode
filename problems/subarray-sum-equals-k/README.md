# [560. Subarray Sum Equals K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-sum-equals-k/)

Given an array of integers and an integer **k**, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to **k**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```
**Note:**
The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].

## Explanation
