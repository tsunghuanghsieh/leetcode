# [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

**Constraints:**
* `n == height.length`
* <code>1 <= n <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup></code>
* <code>0 <= height[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
