# [2055. Plates Between Candles](https://leetcode.com/problems/plates-between-candles/)

There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it. You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'|'` only, where a `'*'` represents a **plate** and a `'|'` represents a **candle**.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [lefti, righti]` denotes the **substring** `s[lefti...righti]` (**inclusive**). For each query, you need to find the **number** of plates **between candles** that are **in the substring**. A plate is considered **between candles** if there is at least one candle to its left and at least one candle to its right **in the substring**.

For example, `s = "||**||**|*"`, and a query `[3, 8]` denotes the substring `"*||**|"`. The number of plates between candles in this substring is `2`, as each of the two plates has at least one candle **in the substring** to its left **and** right.
Return _an integer array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> query_.

**Example 1:**

![Example 1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-1.png)
```
Input: s = "**|**|***|", queries = [[2,5],[5,9]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
- queries[0] has two plates between candles.
- queries[1] has three plates between candles.
```

**Example 2:**

![Example 2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-2.png)
```
Input: s = "***|**|*****|**||**|*", queries = [[1,17],[4,5],[14,17],[5,11],[15,16]]
Output: [9,0,0,0,0]
Explanation:
- queries[0] has nine plates between candles.
- The other queries have zero plates between candles.
```

**Constraints:**
* `3 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of `'*'` and `'|'` characters.
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
* `queries[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= lefti <= righti < s.length`
