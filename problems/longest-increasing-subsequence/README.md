# [300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **strictly increasing** subsequence_, a **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
* <code>-10<sup>4</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
