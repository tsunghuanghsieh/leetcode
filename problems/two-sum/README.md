1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:
```
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].
```

This is a lousy problem description. It does not provide clear information on the problem.
1. size of array. (test case shows as many as 17000+ elements)
2. range of the integers in the array, if the integers is positive or negative, if the integer is too big for data type number.
3. uniqueness of integers in the array. (test cases shows it is not)
