# [126. Word Ladder II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/)

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words <code>beginWord -&gt; s<sub>1</sub> -&gt; s<sub>2</sub> -&gt; ... -&gt; s<sub>k</sub></code> such that:

* Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
* Every `si` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.
* `sk == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return _all the **shortest transformation sequences** from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words `[beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk]`_.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= beginWord.length <= 5`
* `endWord.length == beginWord.length`
* `1 <= wordList.length <= 500`
* `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
* `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
* `beginWord != endWord`
* All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
* The **sum** of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed <code>10<sup>5</sup></code>.
