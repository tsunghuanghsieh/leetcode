# [238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self)

Given an integer array `nums`, return _an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`_.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**
* <code>2 <= nums.length <= 10<sub>5</sub></code>
* `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
* The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
