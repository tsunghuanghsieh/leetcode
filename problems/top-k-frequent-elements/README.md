# [347. Top K Frequent Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` _most frequent elements_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
* `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
* It is **guaranteed** that the answer is **unique**.

**Follow up**: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than `O(n log n)`, where n is the array's size.
