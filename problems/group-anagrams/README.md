[49. Group Anagrams](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/)

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the **anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

**Constraints:**
* `1 <= strs.length <= 10^4`
* `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
* `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

Empirical data confirms anagrams in `strs` can be of different length.
